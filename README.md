# cd-cars-datasets
CD-CARS datasets used in my PhD thesis in Computer Science.

We provide here two datasets. One of them for evaluating CD-CARS algorithms in two more related domains (Book and Television) and another considering two less related domains (Book and Music). These datasets were adapted and extracted from [1], which contains ratings (five-star scale), product metadata and review information about different Amazon products (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html). In addition to these data, we included contextual information regarding three contextual dimensions: Temporal, Location and Companion, respectively, inferred from the ratings' dates, users' static addresses (obtained from their account on Amazon), and users' rating reviews.
